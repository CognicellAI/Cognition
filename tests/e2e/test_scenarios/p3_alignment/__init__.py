"""P3-ALN Business Scenarios: Deep Agents Alignment.

As a platform engineer,
I want Cognition to use upstream deepagents library correctly
so that we get bug fixes and features automatically without custom reimplementations.

Business Value:
- Reduced maintenance burden via upstream alignment
- Correct behavior via battle-tested library code
- Consistent API with deepagents ecosystem

P3-ALN Items Covered:
- P3-ALN-1: Sandbox Backend Alignment (via LocalShellBackend)
- P3-ALN-2: Remove ExecutionBackend Protocol (architecture cleanup)
- P3-ALN-3: Fix CLI Middleware Import & Tool Name Validation
